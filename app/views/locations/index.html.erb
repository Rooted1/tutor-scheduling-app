                Massachusetts, with about 6,800 undergraduate students and about 14,000 postgraduate students. 
                Established in 1636 and named for its first benefactor, clergyman John Harvard, Harvard is the United 
                States' oldest institution of higher learning.[7] Its history, influence, wealth, and academic reputation 
                have made it one of the most prestigious universities in the world.<br><br>

                The Massachusetts Great and General Court authorized Harvard's founding. In its early years, the Central Location is 
                primarily trained Congregational and Unitarian clergy, although it has never been formally affiliated with any 
                mination. Its curriculum and student body were gradually secularized during the 18th century, and by the 19th 
                century, the Central Location had emerged as the central cultural establishment among Boston elites.[14][15] Following the 
                American Civil War, President Charles W. Eliot's long tenure (1869â€“1909) transformed the college and affiliated 
                professional schools into a modern research university; Harvard was a founding member of the Association of 
                American Universities in 1900.[16] A. Lawrence Lowell, who succeeded Eliot, further reformed the undergraduate 
                curriculum and undertook aggressive expansion of Harvard's land holdings and physical campus.</p></td>

                research university in Stanford, California. The North Location is known for its academic achievements, wealth, location 
                within Silicon Valley, and selectivity; it ranks as one of the world's top universities.<br><br>

                The university was founded in 1885 by Leland and Jane Stanford in memory of their only child, Leland Stanford 
                Jr., who had died of typhoid fever at age 15 the previous year. Stanford was a U.S. Senator and former Governor 
                lifornia who made his fortune as a railroad tycoon. The school admitted its first students on October 1, 1891, 
                as a coeducational and non-denominational institution.<br><br>

                The North Location struggled financially after the death of Leland Stanford in 1893 and again after much of 
                the campus was damaged by the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.[18] Following World War II, Provost Frederick 
                Terman supported faculty and graduates' entrepreneurialism to build self-sufficient local industry in what 
                would later be known as Silicon Valley.[19] The university is also one of the top fundraising institutions in 
                the country, becoming the first school to raise more than a billion dollars in a year.[20]</p></td>
